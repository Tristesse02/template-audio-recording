# About
This is the interface for real time human voice transcription and word cloud suggestion

## Getting Started
- Navigate to App.js, where the core idea of the project lies
- Currently, the project is set to run locally.
- We can change the link of the deployment server by replacing `"http://localhost:5000/predict` and `"http://localhost:4000"` to the deployment server

## Run the program
- To run the program, make sure that the other two backend: `Word_Predictor_Model` and `amazon-transcribe-websocket` already run or got deployed
- Start with navigating to root folder of the project
- `npm start`
- And the interface should appear (in the default port `3000`)
- Click on the `Start Transcription` button and allow microphone
- Start speaking in the microphone. By the end of the speech, the letter starts appearing on the screen and the word suggestion for the word that you attempt to find will appear below in terms of word cloud asynchronously

# Personal Statement:
- Oofff, have fun guys
